# LeetCode Solutions in Go

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems implemented in Go.

## Structure

```
.
├── easy/           # Easy difficulty problems
├── medium/         # Medium difficulty problems
├── hard/           # Hard difficulty problems
└── README.md       # This file
```

## Naming Convention

Each solution file is named using the pattern: `{problem_number}_{problem_name}.go`

Example: `001_two_sum.go`

## Running Solutions

```bash
# Run a specific solution
go run easy/001_two_sum.go

# Run tests for a solution
go test ./easy -v -run TestTwoSum
```

## Progress

- Easy: 0
- Medium: 0
- Hard: 0
- Total: 0

## Notes

Each solution includes:
- Problem description (as comments)
- Solution implementation
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Test cases (where applicable)
